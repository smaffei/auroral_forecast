# auroral_forecast

## Overview

This repository contains estimates for the auroral zones boundaries for the years 2020 and 2070. 

These estimates are based on existing geomagnetic field models and forecasts. In particular the configuration of the geomagnetic field in 2020 is taken from the IGRF13 (Alken et al., 2021), while estimates for the geomagnetic field in 2070 are taken from three different sources: 

1) the data assimilation forecast from Sanchez et al., 2020;
2) a simple linear extrapolation of the IGRF13 model coefficients in time;
3) the single-epoch inversion forecast from Aubert, 2015.
